# Analyzing-NYC-Taxi
This Project is in reference to the Nile University Advanced Big Data Course. 
The Goal is to compute using pyspark: 
1- The average time it takes for a taxi to find its next fare per destination borough.
2- The number of trips that start and end within the same borough.
3- The number of trips that start in one borough and end in another.
